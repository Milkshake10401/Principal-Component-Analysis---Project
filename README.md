Principal Component Analysis - Project

We know that by definition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a way of analyzing multidimensional data. What this means is that we can visualize our weighted data along with its variance in order to eliminate any correlation without data loss or at least minimal data loss.

We use the given sample set, where we will be using the steps of Principal Component analysis to analyze the data in order to obtain a covariance matrix. Moreover, from the covariance matrix we will also attain eigenvalues and eigenvectors such that these values represent the orthogonal directions of maximized variance from our
given sample data. Use the variance and covariance formulas to get each entry in the covariance matrix.
